## 🔎 Project 1: Call Center Trends

### 📌 Objective
To assess the efficiency and performance of call center operations and identify areas of improvement in customer service.

### 📈 Key Insights

- **Call Volume Trends**: Peak call volumes observed during weekdays, particularly mid-week.
- **Agent Performance**: Top-performing agents had shorter average call durations and higher resolution rates.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Correlation between first-call resolution and higher satisfaction scores.
- **Call Abandonment**: Higher during long average wait times, especially in the afternoon.

### 🗂️ Dataset Overview
- Call ID, Agent Name, Department
- Date, Time of Call, Call Duration
- Wait Time, Issue Resolved (Y/N), Satisfaction Score

### 💡 Recommendations
- Optimize staffing during peak hours to reduce wait time.
- Provide targeted training to agents with lower resolution rates.
- Implement a callback system to reduce call abandonment.
